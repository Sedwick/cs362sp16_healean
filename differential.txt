  When compairing the two files i find that it hard to determin major differnece since the output of each project was different.
I find that the way to determin which one is correct would have to be code coverage, but at the same time that only check which
on covers more code. 

  When doing the diff I was able to get 88.21% coverage and my classmates was 45.39%. Now still I find that is hard to say that mine 
is more corret then my classmates. I fidnt hat The reason my test coverage was so high was due to covering more cards then my classmates.

  Now some that I did noticed that I was not able to get the test to pass. Im not sure if this is from my test code or just sheer diffence
between the output of files.
