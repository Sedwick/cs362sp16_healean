Process of Refactoring
* When refactoring I copied the contents of the case statements in to a function with an appropriate function name
  * ex smithLogic
* Once a function was created I added a function definition to the dominion.h file.
* In side the function header definition I made sure the appropriate variabled defined and parameters passed to the function.

Cards Refactored
* Smith
* Outpost
* Seahag
* Treasure Map
* Remodel
