Unittest 1 (initialization)
-- Lines executed:67.69% of 65
-- Used to check if the initialization of the game worked proerly,
    I check many different gamestate properties and compared them
    to what the initialization function specified
-- I querious to why my overage was low. I should have hit all possibilities
    of initializing a game.

Unittest 2 (Shuffle)
-- Lines executed:77.50% of 40
-- Shuffled was check to make sure deck were shuffle once a game was
    a game was initialized.
-- I speculate that my coverage was low do to not initializing the game and
    just making decks and shuffling them.

Unittest 3 (numHandCards)
-- Lines executed:75.61% of 41
-- I was check to make sure the the correct number of cards where passed
    back from the numHandCards.
-- I speculate that my coverage was low do to not initializing the game
    and just force feeding cards in to hands.

Unittest 4 (whoseTurn)
-- Lines executed:78.26% of 23
-- For this one I set a play for the current turn, then called the whoesTurn function
    then compared it to the player I se it to.
-- Just like test 2 and 3 my test coverage was low to do not initializing the game.

Cardtest 1 (great_hall)
-- Lines executed:87.50% of 32
-- For great_hall, I make sure that the numAction was increased to ensure that the method worked.
-- Another way that would have work was looked at the deck cout and discard pile after running the test.

Cardtest 2 (gardens)
-- Lines executed:87.88% of 33
-- Gardens was interesting to test because it only returns a -1 with no other action, so to test
    this I just made sure I received a -1 from card effect.
-- What is interesting for this is that I didnt get a 100% code coverage event thought is only tested on switch case.

Cardtest 3 (smithy)
-- Lines executed:87.50% of 32
-- For Smithy I check the card count before and after the cardEffect function call. This was to make sure that
    I received three cards and discarded on card.
-- Another way of testing this would be also beck the player deck and discard pile.

Cardtest 4 (outpost)
-- Lines executed:87.10% of 31
-- For Outpost I tested to make sure that outpost was increased once cardEffect was called. I held the current
    count and compared it to the count after words.
-- I not sure how else to check this test cardEffect becase it only does one thing.
